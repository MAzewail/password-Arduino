# Password Project with LCD and Keypad

This repository contains an Arduino code for a password project that utilizes an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and a keypad. The code allows you to create a password-protected system where users can enter a predefined password using the keypad, and the LCD displays whether the entered password is correct or incorrect.

## Requirements

To use this code, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LCD module (compatible with the LiquidCrystal library)
- Keypad module
- Jumper wires

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
3. Connect the LCD module to your Arduino board. Refer to the documentation of your specific LCD module for the pin connections.
4. Connect the keypad module to your Arduino board. Again, refer to the documentation for the pin connections.
5. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to **File > Open**. Select the `Password_Project.ino` file from the repository.
6. Upload the code to your Arduino board by clicking on the "Upload" button or pressing **Ctrl+U**.
7. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE by clicking on the "Serial Monitor" button or pressing **Ctrl+Shift+M**.
8. Make sure the baud rate in the serial monitor is set to match the baud rate specified in the code (default is 9600).
9. The LCD will display "Enter Password:" and you can start entering the password using the keypad.
10. If the entered password matches the predefined password, the LCD will display "Access Granted." Otherwise, it will display "Access Denied."

## Usage

The provided code is a basic example that demonstrates how to create a password-protected system using an LCD and a keypad. You can modify and extend the code to suit your specific requirements. Here are a few ideas:

- Implement additional functionality, such as controlling an electronic lock or triggering an alarm when the password is incorrect.
- Add multiple user support with different passwords.
- Enhance the user interface by displaying more information on the LCD, such as the number of attempts remaining or the status of the system.

Feel free to customize the code and experiment with different features to create your desired password project.
